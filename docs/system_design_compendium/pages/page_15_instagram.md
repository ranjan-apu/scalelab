## 1. Problem Overview & Architectural Scoping

### Problem Summary
Designing **Photo Sharing App (Instagram)** requires architecting a production-grade distributed solution in the **Media Processing, Feed Generation & CDN** space. The system must support massive scale while balancing latency budgets, throughput requirements, data consistency, and system durability.

### Primary Technical Challenges
- **Throughput & Concurrency**: Handling high-volume traffic bursts, contention on hot resources, and partition skew without service degradation.
- **Consistency vs Availability**: Choosing the appropriate consistency model across distributed components (ACID transactions vs eventual consistency).
- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**: Isolating failure domains, avoiding cascading collapses, and ensuring graceful degradation under partial system outages.

## 2. Requirements Specification

### Functional Requirements
Core Requirements
- Users should be able to create posts featuring photos, videos, and a simple caption.
- Users should be able to follow other users.
- Users should be able to see a chronological feed of posts from the users they follow.
Below the line (out of scope):
- Users should be able to like and comment on posts.
- Users should be able to search for users, hashtags, or locations.
- Users should be able to create and view stories (ephemeral content).
- Users should be able to go live (real-time video streaming).
FIRST QUESTION
What are the non-functional requirements for this system?
Try it yourself first
We recommend you to practice the question yourself first to get instant personalized feedback as you go.

### Non-Functional Requirements & Performance SLOs
If you're someone who often struggles to come up with your non-functional requirements, take a look at this list of common non-functional requirements that should be considered. Just remember, most systems are all these things (fault tolerant, scalable, etc) but your goal is to identify the unique characteristics that make this system challenging or unique.
Before defining your non-functional requirements in an interview, it's wise to inquire about the scale of the system as this will have a meaningful impact on your design. In this case, we'll be looking at a system with 500M DAU with 100M posts per day.

## 3. Quantitative Scale & Capacity Estimations

| Metric Dimension | Production Scale | Architectural Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Active Users (DAU)** | 50M - 200M users | Distributed identity verification, user sharding, session caches. |
| **Write Throughput** | 1,000 - 50,000 QPS peak | Asynchronous ingestion queues (Kafka), write-behind caching, batch persistence. |
| **Read Throughput** | 10,000 - 500,000 QPS peak | Multi-tier CDN caching, distributed Redis read clusters, read replicas. |
| **Storage Capacity (5 Years)** | 10 TB - 500 TB | Columnar analytics storage, cold data tiering to object storage (S3). |
| **Network Egress / Ingress** | 1 Gbps - 40 Gbps | Connection multiplexing, compression (gzip/zstd), CDN edge offload. |

## 4. Core Data Entities & Schema Design

- **Primary Entity**: `id` (UUID PK), `owner_id` (UUID), `status` (ENUM), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP).
- **Transaction / Event Log**: `event_id` (UUID), `entity_id` (UUID FK), `payload` (JSONB), `timestamp` (BIGINT).
- **Aggregated / Materialized View**: `partition_key` (STRING), `window_start` (BIGINT), `counter` (BIGINT).

## 5. API & System Interface Contract

```http
POST /api/v1/resource
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "action": "execute",
  "payload": {}
}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## 6. High-Level Architecture & End-to-End Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User([Client / App]) --> Edge[Global Anycast DNS / CDN]
    Edge --> LB[Application Load Balancer]
    LB --> Gateway[API Gateway & Rate Limiter]
    Gateway --> Service[Core Domain Service]
    Service --> Cache[(Distributed Cache - Redis)]
    Service --> DB[(Primary Transactional DB)]
    Service --> Broker[Message Stream - Kafka]
    Broker --> Worker[Worker Fleet / Stream Engine]
    Worker --> Storage[(Analytical / Object Storage)]
```

### Execution Workflow
1. **Edge Ingestion**: Requests pass through Edge CDN and API Gateway for rate limiting and authentication.
2. **Fast-Path Caching**: High-frequency reads are resolved from the distributed Redis cache with sub-5ms latency.
3. **Asynchronous Decoupling**: High-velocity write events are published directly to Kafka message broker partitions.
4. **Background Processing**: Stream workers (Flink/Workers) consume events, update read-model projections, and persist to long-term storage.

## 7. Deep Dives, Bottlenecks & Architectural Tradeoffs

### 1) The system should deliver feed content with low latency (< 500ms )
### 2) The system should render photos and videos instantly, supporting photos up to 8mb and videos up to 4GB
### 3) The system should be scalable to support 500M DAU

## 9. ScaleLab Studio Simulation & Practice Pack Mapping

- **Recommended ScaleLab Palette Components**: `Client`, `Load balancer`, `API gateway`, `Service`, `Queue`, `Worker`, `Database`, `Cache`, `Circuit breaker`.
- **Simulation Load Test**: Configure a 'Spike' or 'Diurnal' traffic shape. Simulate worker crashes or database lock contention to observe queue backup and Little's Law latency spikes.
- **Practice Pack Readiness**: High priority candidate for addition to ScaleLab's guided practice suite with pinnable notes and runnable starter topologies.
